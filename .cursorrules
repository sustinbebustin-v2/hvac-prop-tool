# Multi-Agent Scratchpad

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

Starting Phase 1: Discovery and Design Phase
- Task: Initialize project setup and begin requirements gathering
- Status: In Progress

Technical Setup Progress:
- ‚úÖ Created new Vite + React + TypeScript project
- ‚úÖ Installed core dependencies:
  - Mantine UI framework for Apple-inspired components
  - Framer Motion for smooth animations
  - Redux Toolkit for state management
  - React Router for navigation
  - Tabler Icons for consistent iconography
  - Mantine Form for form handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Encountering TypeScript type issues with Mantine components
- üîÑ Next: Resolve type issues and continue component implementation

## Next Steps and Action Items

1. Resolve TypeScript type issues:
   - Fix type definitions for Mantine components
   - Ensure proper typing for theme and styling props
   - Address component prop type mismatches
2. Continue implementing core UI components:
   - Layout components (AppShell, Navigation)
   - Proposal editor interface
   - Preview components
3. Set up state management structure with Redux Toolkit

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

Encountering TypeScript type issues with Mantine components:
1. Mantine component props (Stack, NavLink, etc.) are showing type mismatches with their expected props
2. Theme utility functions (theme.fn) are not recognized in the type system
3. Need guidance on proper type definitions for Mantine components and theme

Requesting Planner's assistance to:
1. Verify correct versions of @mantine/* packages for TypeScript support
2. Provide guidance on proper type definitions and component usage
3. Suggest approach for handling theme typing across components
